# Project Title: Site Suitability Analysis for Sustainable Housing Developments in Exeter, Devon

For any housing development to be termed "sustainable", it must be environmentally safe (i.e. safe from flooding and terrain risks) and socially accessible (i.e. within proximity to existing infrastructural developments).

This study focused on Exeter, a city in Devon, South-West England with a population of 130,700 in 2021 as at the 2021 Census. In 2021, Exeter was home to around 19.8 people per football pitch-sized (approximately 7,140sqm) piece of land, compared with 17.9 in 2011. This area was among the top 25% most densely populated English local authority areas at the last census (How life has changed in Exeter: Census 2021). 

Exeter is a perfect case study for the need to create balance between housing needs and environmental protection. It is well-known for complex topography that ranges from the low-lying and flood-prone valley of the River Exeter to the steep gradients of the northern hills such as Pennsylvania and Exwick

This repository contains the R code, spatial data, and outputs for a site suitability analysis assessing potential locations for sustainable housing developments in Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom.

## Files
# Script
- The "Site_Suitability_Analysis" is the R script used for data processing, analysis, and map generation.

# Data
- Exeter_DTM_1m.tif – LiDAR Composite Digital Terrain Model (DTM), 1 m resolution (2022)
- rofrs_4band_Exeter.shp – Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Sea shapefile  
	The two datasets were sourced from https://environment.data.gov.uk
- Data of road network, supermarkets, hospitals, and schools were retrieved from the OpenStreetMap through the API (see script)

## Outputs
The "Outputs" folder contains exported raster, vector, and image files, including final map layouts created in QGIS.
The following layouts were designed in QGIS Layout Manager using vector and raster files generated from the analysis:
- EXETER_HOSPITALS_PROXIMITY_LAYOUT
- EXETER_SUPERMARKETS_PROXIMITY_LAYOUT
- EXETER_FLOOD_RISK_LAYOUT
- EXETER_ROADS_PROXIMITY_LAYOUT
- EXETER_SCHOOLS_PROXIMITY_ANALYSIS
- EXETER_SLOPE_ANALYSIS_LAYOUT
- EXETER_SUITABILITY_SCORE_LAYOUT

All remaining images were exported directly from the analysis results in RStudio.

## How to Run
Ensure the script and the data are located in the same working directory.  
Run the script from the project root using relative file paths.
